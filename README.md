# Phonebook

React app that functions as a phonebook. People's names and numbers can be added, modified, deleted, and searched from it. Duplicate numbers will throw up an error to the user and will not be added to the phonebook. The phonebook's data is stored in a JSON file that is accessed once the JSON server is run. This app has not been styled yet.
